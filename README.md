# Balancing-Your-Budget
Java - Hacks Academy at Gilmour Academy (Spring 2020)

Here is a project I worked during a 24-hour hackathon at Gilmour Academy. The prompt was to solve a social problem. My group decided to tackle the issue of poverty and how to reduce reckless spending. We created an application to track the income and expenses of an individual's budget. 

I ended up being the leader of the project and split off tasks to give to my other group members. I had to create a UI for the application and handle the inputs and outputs. Being the leader, I ended up taking all of the code and putting it together into a single file; you can see a lot of my style of coding in the functions directing the program.

# Summary of the Files

src - Folder that holds the rest of the files

Main - Where all of the magic happens; I have most things commented as that was a requirement for the hackathon (Doesn't make it easier to read though)

Source - A class I created to hold values relating to a person's incomes and expenses. Nothing much is located here; just a few variables and setters and getters

TableCellListener - A class I used to color in the javaTable cells' background. I didn't code this, all credit goes to the source: https://tips4java.wordpress.com/2009/06/07/table-cell-listener/

Person# - Files used to show off the features of the application while presenting for the hackathon. Created using the save function in the program

# Where to Start

There is only one main function to start the program with. That function is located in the main file. I would suggest using the file reader input method at first. Just make sure that method is selected, type in the file you want to read (Person#), hit find and then hit start.
